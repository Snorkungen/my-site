## What is web-design?

In my humble opinion web-design is an art. The goal is to design a user interface that is easy to understand, and nice to look at.
 
## Why i find web-design difficult.

As i stated it's an art and i don't do art. More importantly i think making something look nice in vacuum is difficult (no feedback). So lastly i think you need multiple opinions to compromise on a good design. And what are others opnions but noise.
